In object-oriented design, the chain-of-responsibility pattern is a behavioral design pattern consisting of a source
of command objects and a series of processing objects.

Chain of Responsibility is a behavioral design pattern that lets you pass requests along a chain of handlers. Upon
receiving a request, each handler decides either to process the request or to pass it to the next handler in the chain.
