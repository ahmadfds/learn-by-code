Prune and search is a method of solving optimization problems suggested by Nimrod Megiddo in 1983.

The basic idea of the method is a recursive procedure in which at each step the input size is reduced
("pruned") by a constant factor 0 < p < 1. As such, it is a form of decrease and conquer algorithm, where
at each step the decrease is by a constant factor.
