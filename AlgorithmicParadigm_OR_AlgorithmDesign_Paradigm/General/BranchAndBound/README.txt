Example: Printing Items in 0/1 Knapsack

Given weights and values of n items, put these items in a knapsack of capacity W to get the maximum total
value in the knapsack. In other words, given two integer arrays, val[0..n-1] and wt[0..n-1] represent values
and weights associated with n items respectively. Also given an integer W which represents knapsack capacity,
find out the items such that sum of the weights of those items of a given subset is smaller than or equal to W.
You cannot break an item, either pick the complete item or donâ€™t pick it (0-1 property).
